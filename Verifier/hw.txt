program {  
	n = 100;  
	p = 1;
	x = read();
        while (p =< n and x <> a(p)) {

Notes:

1. You have to fill in the input and output condition.

2. In writing the output condition you may make use of the 
   notation (x <> a(p:q)) to mean x <> a[p] ... x <> a[q].
   
3. Conditional formula is written such as ((x = y+z) --> (p*q <> a(100)))

input (x = m) and (y = n)
output x = gcd(m, n)
program 
     {
     	while (not (x=y)) {
	      if (x > y) 
		   {x = x-y;}
	      else {y = y-x;};

     }.

The lexical analyzer will not read past the '.', so everything here
is just a comment.

Enter the following loop invariant for the above program:

gcd(x,y) = gcd(m,n).
